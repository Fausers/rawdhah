                            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
                            indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
                            and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
                            moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to
                            ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                            in their duty through weakness of will, which is
                            the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                            and pain.

                        <p>
                            These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                            distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
                            choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents
                            our being able to do what we like best, every
                            pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
                            But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims
                            of duty or the obligations of business it will
                            frequently occur that pleasures have to be
                            repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
                            therefore always holds in these matters to this
                            principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                            secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
                            pains to avoid worse pains.
